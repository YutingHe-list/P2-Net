# P$^2$-Net: Multi-task Learning for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Prognosis Prediction via Memory Drift and Prior Prompt Learning on 3D Chest CT

[NOTE!!]**The code will be gradually opened, and be completely opened after this paper is published.**

The P$^2$-Net is a novel multi-task 3D prognosis prediction framework on chest CT images which advances the optimization of the prognosis prediction DL models and improve the perception of task-dependent features on low-contrast ROIs. Technically, it copes with two large challenges in DL-based 3D medical image prognosis model including unreliable loss caused by a large volume of 3D CT and the inefficient feature representation caused by low-contrast ROIs. This study on the embedding of prior knowledge via multi-task learning for task-dependent representation and the memory-based reliable distribution for robust optimization shows large superiority in the pulmonary arterial hypertension prognosis prediction.
